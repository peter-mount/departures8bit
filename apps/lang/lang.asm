TokenNoResponse = 0     ; No response
TokenError      = 1     ; Error, shows an error message

; Token lookup table that links the token's to code to run when they are
; "executed". Not all tokens are to be executed as some are data markers
; e.g. TokenTiploc holds the definition for a tiploc in the result so it
; has separate code to search those.
; As such, and as we can lookup a max of 128 tokens in a single page
; this table maps tokens 0..127. Tokens with bit 8 set (128+) are not
; executable and are used for these lookup items.

; The language lines are stored in memory from dataBase.
; Each line consists of:
; 2 bytes for the address of the next line, 0x0000 marking the end of the "program"
; This is followed by the content of the line, normally terminating with 0 if a string
; but the 0 terminator isn't necessary for fixed format lines.

; relocateLang          Relocates the code at dataBase so that the next line addresses
;                       are correct. When first received these are based from 0x0000
;                       as the true address is dependent on the client.
;                       e.g. The BBC Micro, BBC Master 128 & C64 all use different values.
