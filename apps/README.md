Notes:
* \* included for reference only.
* C000-DFFF is specific to the BBC Master. Not available on the BBC Model B/Electron.
  It's only included here incase we want to try to squeeze more memory at a future date.
  Unlikely whilst we have 3 spare pages at 0500-07FF available.
* On BBC the lowest available ram is 0E00 although on BBC B/Electron it can be higher with filesystem usage - the Master has alternate memory.
* The upper ram on BBC & C64 is 7FFF but on the C64 we can page out Basic giving us an additional 8K + a 4K unused block which we do use.
* The BBC has 0400-07FF reserved for the running language, which we are, so we use that.
  Likewise on the C64 we use that space as it's the default screen location but as we relocate that, we use it as well.
* The C64 page 08 holds our basic loader which is unused once running so we can reuse that if necessary.
